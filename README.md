Generate RSS news feeds for Hoyoverse games like Genshin Impact or Honkai Starrail based
on the official [Hoyolab](https://www.hoyolab.com) forum posts. Available feed formats
are [Atom](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4287) and [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org).
This application is supposed to run periodically by a cronjob for example.

There are some [feeds](https://c3kay.de/hoyolab-rss-feeds) already hosted by myself!

## Installation

You need at least Python 3.10 and the package manager Pip installed. You can then
install this package from PyPI with:

```shell
pip install hoyolab-rss-feeds
```

## Usage

### CLI

You can run the application like this:

```shell
hoyolab-rss-feeds
```

or as module:

```shell
python -m hoyolabrssfeeds
```

If no configuration can be found, the application will create a default config
in your current directory (`./hoyolab-rss-feeds.toml`) and will exit afterward.

You can specify a path for the config file with a parameter:

```shell
hoyolab-rss-feeds -c path/to/config.toml
```

### Module

It is also possible to generate the feeds via code:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from hoyolabrssfeeds import FeedConfigLoader, GameFeed, GameFeedCollection, Game

async def generate_feeds():
    loader = FeedConfigLoader(Path("path/to/config.toml"))
    
    # all games in config
    all_configs = await loader.get_all_feed_configs()
    feed_collection = GameFeedCollection.from_configs(all_configs)
    await feed_collection.create_feeds()
    
    # only a single game
    genshin_config = await loader.get_feed_config(Game.GENSHIN)
    genshin_feed = GameFeed.from_config(genshin_config)
    await genshin_feed.create_feed()
```

[Here](https://gist.github.com/c3kay/2cd9833ef1c527e210aebf7a866336ed)
you can find an example on how to create a feed without using the TOML config file.

## Configuration

In the TOML config file you can define for which games you want to create a feed
and in which format the feeds should be. Here is an example config:

```toml
language = "de-de"
category_size = 15

[genshin]
feed.json.path = "path/to/genshin.json"
feed.json.url = "https://example.org/genshin.json"
categories = ["Info", "Notices"]
category_size = 5
title = "Genshin Impact News"
icon = "https://example.org/icon.png"

[starrail]
feed.json.path = "path/to/starrail.json"
feed.json.url = "https://example.org/starrail.json"
feed.atom.path = "path/to/starrail.xml"
feed.atom.url = "https://example.org/starrail.xml"
```

A minimal configuration requires at least one game section with a `feed.<format>.path`
entry. Available feed formats are currently `json` and `atom`. You can either use
one format or both.

Entries defined at root level are considered default values and will apply to every
game section. The `feed` key can only be used in a game section. All other keys
can be defined at root level, and they can be overwritten by a game section.

The `categories` list defines the selected Hoyolab categories (*Info*, *Event* and
*Notices*) for this feed. If this entry is omitted, all categories are selected.
The `category_size` entry defines the amount of feed items (default: 5) of a category
for each feed. 

**Note:** When using Windows file paths (like `C:\\path\to\config.toml`), single quotes
should be used to avoid wrong auto-escaping of backslashes. More info about the TOML
format can be found in the [official documentation](https://toml.io/en/).

### Logging

Simple logs at level `INFO` are written to the terminal by default. If a file path is given
via parameter (`-l /path/to/out.log`), the logs are written to this file.

If the application is run via code, the logger must be 
[configured](https://docs.python.org/3.11/howto/logging.html#configuring-logging) separately. 
The application specific logger is available by:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("hoyolabrssfeeds")
```
